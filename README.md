# Cain for Foundry

This repo contains the world/files/templates for the CSB system for [CAIN created by Tom Bloom](https://tombloom.itch.io/cain).
Have questions? You can reach out to me @calicoskunk on PNET or the unofficial CAIN discord.

## Use

This module is intended for use with the [Custom System Builder](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/custom-system-builder/) System. It will not work in other systems.

Once you have installed the module and its compendia, make sure you do the following:

1. Go to the Compendium Items tab in Foundry.
2. Right click on each of the added compendia, and import all content.

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST keep document ids or else the sheets will not work properly!

3. Done! If an update does come out, simply do this again.

**IMPORTANT:** After importing, its a good idea to reload all character sheets (if you're updating).

## Creating a character

1. Create a new actor as normal.

Done.

### Adding Agendas

1.  Open the `Compendium Packs` tab on the top right.
2.  Open the `Agendas` Compendium.
3.  Drag your Agenda from the Compendium anywhere onto the sheet.

It should look like this when you are done:

**Note:** Because of the nature of "bolded agenda items" and their overhead, I've left it as a "add as you will" type system.
To add a "bolded agenda item", click on the `+` symbol on the far right of the table and input your bolded item manually.

**Hint:** You can click on the Agenda inside of your sheet for a quick and easy reference/copy-paste.

**Agenda Abilities** are the same as Agendas. You will find them in the Compendium alongside their associated Agenda, and also within the Agenda itself. Simply drag them anywhere onto your sheet.
